I would love to see Bloomington Lake in Paris, Idaho, about an hour away from Bear Lake. It has a pretty hike up to it if its not in the 
snow. Unfortunately, my friends and I went last year in June where there was still snow. I have no idea if we took the actual
trail or not. 

It was fun to still go with friends even though we could not park at the trailhead. We had to walk at least
an extra mile in the snow. I can only imagine what the Utah Pioneers went through in worse conditions.
