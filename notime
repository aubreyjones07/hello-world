While I want to spend time with them and do not have dates for when I can challenge out of classes, I need to keep in mind 
of the final date to drop classes before students lose tuition money. I would definitely hate to lose out on a few 
$$$ after challenging out of a class. That could pay for summer semester that was out of pocket, just sayin'.
