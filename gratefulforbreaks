I am glad that I have breaks here and there to work on what I need to do. My family wants to not take Bear Lake for granted and 
enjoy so many activities up there. I hope I can do at least some of them rather than stay at the house all weekend. 


I would hate to go to Bear Lake only to stay at the house all day.

I wonder how crowded Bear Lake will be on a holiday weekend. Hmm.
